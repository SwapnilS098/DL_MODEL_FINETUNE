lambda 0.3 provides great performance in terms of the SSIM and the PSNR of the image 
reconstruction. 
The compression ratio might have compromised. But that is not yet taken into the c
consideration because of the ability to control the second stage of the compression
using the traditional codecs.



Original model is the BMSHJ2018 with quality of 4 and MS_SSIM

results on the datset of 5 images
