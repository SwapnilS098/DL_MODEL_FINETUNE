lambda 0.3 provides great performance in terms of the SSIM and the PSNR of the image 
reconstruction. 
The compression ratio might have compromised. But that is not yet taken into the c
consideration because of the ability to control the second stage of the compression
using the traditional codecs.

Took almost 1 day for the fine tuning, the loss at the end was 7.8 something and the 
aux loss was also around 140 

Maybe need to change the learning rates for getting the lower loss

Original model is the BMSHJ2018 with quality of 4 and MS_SSIM


Performance is impressive.
